## **2.1 Types of Neural Networks**  

### **1. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  
- **Type:** Feedforward neural network  
- **Learning:** Supervised  
- **Use Case:** Regression, classification, and basic pattern recognition  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Simplest form of an artificial neural network (ANN)  
  - Consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer  
  - Uses backpropagation for training  

### **2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- **Type:** Feedforward neural network  
- **Learning:** Supervised  
- **Use Case:** Image and video processing (object detection, classification, segmentation)  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Uses convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies (edges, textures, shapes)  
  - Includes pooling layers for dimensionality reduction  
  - Popular architectures: ResNet, VGG, AlexNet  

### **3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**  
- **Type:** Feedback neural network  
- **Learning:** Supervised/Unsupervised  
- **Use Case:** Sequential data (text, speech, time series)  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Processes sequences using loops (memory of previous inputs)  
  - Suffers from vanishing/exploding gradients  
  - Variants: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)  

### **4. Autoencoder**  
- **Type:** Unsupervised neural network  
- **Learning:** Self-supervised (reconstructs input)  
- **Use Case:** Dimensionality reduction, denoising, anomaly detection  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Symmetric architecture (encoder compresses, decoder reconstructs)  
  - Used in generative models and feature extraction  

### **5. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**  
- **Type:** Generative neural network  
- **Learning:** Unsupervised  
- **Use Case:** Image generation, style transfer, music/story synthesis  
- **Characteristics:**  
  - Consists of two networks: **Generator** (creates fake data) and **Discriminator** (detects fakes)  
  - Applications: Deepfake, AI art, synthetic media

## **2.2 History of Deep Learning**  

### **Chapter 1: The Perceptron (1960s)**  
- **Frank Rosenblatt** introduced the **perceptron**, an early ANN model.  
- Claimed it could learn and adapt like a human brain.  

### **Chapter 2: The First AI Winter (1969)**  
- **Minsky & Papert** proved perceptrons **cannot learn non-linear functions (e.g., XOR)**.  
- Funding and interest in neural networks declined.  

### **Chapter 3: The Rise of Deep Learning (1980s)**  
- **Geoffrey Hinton** (father of deep learning) published **backpropagation** (1986).  
- **Yann LeCun** (Hinton’s student) developed **CNN** (1989) for handwritten digit recognition.  

### **Chapter 4: The Second AI Winter (1990s)**  
- Neural networks struggled due to:  
  - **Lack of labeled data**  
  - **Insufficient computational power**  
  - **Poor weight initialization**  
- Alternative algorithms (SVM, Random Forest) outperformed ANNs.  

### **Chapter 5: Deep Learning Revival (2006)**  
- Hinton’s paper: **"Unsupervised Pre-training for Deep Networks"**  
- Introduced **layer-wise weight initialization**, leading to modern deep learning.  

### **Chapter 6: Deep Learning Dominance (2012-Present)**  
- **AlexNet (2012)** won ImageNet using **GPUs**, sparking a deep learning revolution.  
- Breakthroughs in **GANs, Transformers (BERT, GPT), and reinforcement learning (AlphaGo)**.
