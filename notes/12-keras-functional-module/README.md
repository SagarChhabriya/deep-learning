Understood. Here's a clean, professional version focused solely on neural network architecture using Keras, without any informal symbols or decorations.

## Neural Network Design: Sequential vs Functional API

### Sequential API

The Sequential API is appropriate for straightforward architectures where layers are connected one after another without branching or multiple inputs/outputs.

**Use cases:**
- Simple image classification
- Basic regression tasks
- Single input, single output models

**Limitations:**
- Cannot handle multiple inputs or outputs
- Does not support shared layers
- Does not support branching or complex data flows

---

### Functional API

The Functional API allows the construction of flexible and non-linear architectures. It is the preferred approach when dealing with multiple inputs, multiple outputs, or shared layers.

**Use cases:**
- Multi-output models
- Multi-input models
- Models that include branching
- Shared layer models
- Multi-modal data processing (e.g., combining tabular, text, and image data)

---

## Example 1: Multi-Output Model

Predict both age (regression) and place (binary classification) from a single input with three features.

```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense

input_layer = Input(shape=(3,))
hidden1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
hidden2 = Dense(64, activation='relu')(hidden1)

# Output branches
output_age = Dense(1, activation='linear', name='age')(hidden2)
output_place = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', name='place')(hidden2)

# Define the model
model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output_age, output_place])
model.summary()
```

---

## Example 2: Multi-Input Model

Use tabular data, text data, and image data to predict a single output.

```python
from keras.models import Model
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Embedding, LSTM, Conv2D, Flatten, Concatenate

# Tabular input
tabular_input = Input(shape=(10,))
tabular_branch = Dense(32, activation='relu')(tabular_input)

# Text input
text_input = Input(shape=(100,))
text_branch = Embedding(input_dim=10000, output_dim=64)(text_input)
text_branch = LSTM(32)(text_branch)

# Image input
image_input = Input(shape=(64, 64, 3))
image_branch = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')(image_input)
image_branch = Flatten()(image_branch)

# Merge all features
merged = Concatenate()([tabular_branch, text_branch, image_branch])
output = Dense(1, activation='linear')(merged)

# Define the model
model = Model(inputs=[tabular_input, text_input, image_input], outputs=output)
model.summary()
```

## When to Use Functional API

Use the Functional API when your model involves any of the following:
- Multiple inputs or outputs
- Shared layers across different parts of the model
- Non-linear data flow or branching paths
- Processing of heterogeneous data types (structured and unstructured)

The Functional API provides the flexibility and clarity required for modern deep learning tasks, particularly in production-grade systems.

### Error: You must install pydot (pip install pydot) for plot_model to work.

```bash
!dot -V

'dot' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

`Graphviz` (the actual graph-rendering tool) isn’t installed yet, which is exactly why `plot_model()` is failing, even though `pydot` is installed.

---

### To Fix It: Install Graphviz on Windows

#### **Step 1: Download Graphviz**
Head here:  
🔗 [https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html)

Click the **“Stable Release Windows installer”** (usually `.exe` file).

#### **Step 2: Install it**
- Run the installer.
- On the install screen, **make sure to check the box** that says:
  > *Add Graphviz to the system PATH for all users*

That’s super important — it’s how Python knows where to find `dot`.

#### **Step 3: Restart your terminal + Jupyter Notebook**
This reloads your updated system PATH.

#### **Step 4: Verify the install**
In a notebook cell, run:
```python
!dot -V
```


---

###  Now try your `plot_model` again:
```python
from tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model
plot_model(model, show_shapes=True)
```
