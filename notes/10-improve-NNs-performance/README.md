# 10. Optimizing Neural Networks

## Core Improvement Strategies

### 1. Architecture Design
- **Layer Depth**: Number of hidden layers (shallow vs deep networks)
- **Width**: Neurons per layer (pyramid structure often used)
- **Rationale**: Deep networks enable hierarchical feature learning and transfer capabilities

### 2. Training Configuration
- **Learning Rate**: Step size for weight updates
- **Batch Size**: Samples per gradient update (small=8-32, large=up to 8192)
- **Epochs**: Complete passes through training data

### 3. Advanced Techniques
- **Optimizers**: Algorithms beyond vanilla GD (Adam, RMSprop)
- **Regularization**: Methods to prevent overfitting (Dropout, L1/L2)
- **Normalization**: BatchNorm for stable training

## Common Challenges & Fixes

### Gradient Problems
- **Vanishing**: Signals become too weak (solved via ReLU, good initialization)
- **Exploding**: Signals grow too large (fixed via gradient clipping)

### Data Issues
- **Scarcity**: Not enough examples (address with transfer learning)
- **Overfitting**: Model memorizes data (prevent with regularization)

### Performance
- **Slow Training**: Accelerate with better optimizers
- **Stagnation**: Monitor with early stopping

## Practical Tips
1. Start with moderate depth, increase gradually
2. Use adaptive optimizers by default
3. Implement BatchNorm and Dropout early
4. Monitor gradient flow statistics
5. Leverage automated callbacks

Remember: There's no universal best configuration - systematic experimentation is essential for optimal results.
