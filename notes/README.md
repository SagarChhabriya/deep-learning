### What is Deep Learning?

Within machine learning, there are various types of algorithms. Think of machine learning algorithms as competing techniques to get the best out of the data. Some algorithms are better in certain aspects, but there’s not one that's the best in all departments.

Deep learning is a type of algorithm that's adaptable to varying complexities of data and rules. It’s not necessarily the most accurate, but it's extremely adaptable. And this comes from its modular and flexible form.
